    <description>If the sum of Mens_College_Club_Small__c, Mens_College_Open_Large__c, Mens_College_Social__c, and Womens_College__c is equal to 0, the formula returns $0.
Cost Calculation:
If there&apos;s only one team (i.e., the sum is equal to 1), it returns the cost for the first team (Cost_1st_Team__c).
If there are multiple teams (sum is greater than 1), it calculates the cost based on the first team cost and the additional teams cost (Cost_Additional_Teams__c), adjusting for the first team&apos;s cost already counted</description>
